        ASR Conference is helping drive the information security agenda worldwide with annual industry events in the U.S.,
        Europe and Japan. <br>
        Throughout its 19 year history, ASR Conference has consistently attracted the world's
        best and brightest in the field, creating opportunities for conference attendees
        to learn about IT security's most important issues through first-hand interactions with peers,
        luminaries and emerging and established companies. <br><br>
        As the IT security field continues to grow in importance and influence,
        ASR Conference plays an integral role in keeping security professionals across the globe connected and educated.<br><br>

        ASR developed the ASR Conference in 1991 as a forum for cryptographers
        to gather and share the latest knowledge and advancements in the area of Internet security. <br>
        Today, the ASR Conference and related, ASR Conference branded activities,
        are still managed by ASR, the Security Division of CMA,
        with the support of the industry.
        ASR Conference event programming is judged and developed
        by information security practitioners and other related professionals.<br><br>
